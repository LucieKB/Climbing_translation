Bolts look relatively new so it couldn't have been established more than a few years ago. Hopefully the FA party will come around and let us know that the name of it is.\n\nFirst bolt is quite a bit up the route but it's easy climbing to get to it. It's pretty cruiser up until that last bolt and getting over the bulge (crux). Once you get over you'll be greeted with chains. I've added a quick-link and two carabiners for easy lower off. Expect a little rope drag still.\n\nJust like with Maple Canyon I would wear a helmet to protect from the inevitable falling rock.",

A second bolt is above the belay a short distance. Otherwise the 1 bolt can be backed up with small cams. 5.9 25m.\n\nPitch 2: Clip a bolt and climb up the dihedral until it seems blockier and loose. You can now Belay on a fairly nice ledge with a new bolt and ring pin. 5.8, 20m.\n\nPitch #3: A few glue in bolts have been added here to enable avoiding the rubble in the dihedral and climb more solid rock to the left. This allows a much more exciting and better protected finish on solid rock. After the last bolt, scramble the short distance to the top and find a two bolt belay on a flat rock. 5.7/8, 20m.\n\nDescent: Walk off to the north and down through a break in the cliffband.",

It is a popular day-hike destination and rightly so for it is the most striking landmark for miles. It is reached by driving to the base of Elephant Hill and finding the trailhead there leading to Chessler Park and Elephant Canyon. Druid Arch is located at the southern end of Elephant Canyon. It is about a 5.4 mile (9 km) hike to the arch over slickrock, sand flats and a dry creek bed; follow the cairns. There are a couple of backcountry campsites lower in the canyon (with permit); the NPS does not allow camping in the Druid Arch corridor. The route is located on the east side of the arch's south leg."

To read more about climbing restrictions in the park, click\n\nhere.\n\nAngel Arch is arguably the most beautiful landform in the Needles district. Its size and position is unrivaled and it is truly the monarch of arches in the region. It is composed of very good Cedar Mesa Sandstone and can now be done entirely hammerless and much of it goes free. At the time of its first ascent it was the largest unclimbed arch on the planet.\n\nThe first ascent of Angel Arch in 1991 followed the obvious wide crack on the east side of the formation.  A rope was fixed over the hump to the north so that they could climb over the hump on the descent.  There is a large flat ledge above the center of the arch. The fourth pitch followed a drilled pin ladder to the summit. The descent follows the route.  All anchors are hidden from view.\n\nIt must be noted that the NPS looks down on climbing named features in these particular national parks. \"Named features\" translates in NPS speak to \"arches.\" They don't seem to mind people climbing the towers and various formations, but for whatever reason they do not like climbers on the arches. If you are caught climbing Angel, Castle, or Druid arch, you will likely be issued a compulsory \"arch climbing permit\", which cost $25 in 1993.  As always, practice sound and environmentally-minded judgement in the desert. It is particularly important that the \"leave no visible trace\" philosophy be exercised here.",
                      "location": "Once upon a time you could drive a 4wd high clearance vehicle down Salt Creek to within a mile of the arch.  The environmental groups sued the NPS and closed the road.  The battles have been in and out of court, and the road has been closed, reopened, and closed again over the years.  Currently the road down Salt Creek is closed to mechanized vehicles.  One can park at the Peekaboo  campsite and backpack the 10 miles in to the arch down Salt Creek.  The approach is easy hiking along the old road, and there is \"at large\" camping allowed in this section of the canyon.  A permit is required. This is a fantastic hike and comes extremely well recommended. Plan on three days for this adventure. A day for the hike in, a day for exploring and bouldering, and a day for the hike out."

To read more about climbing restrictions in the park, click\n\nhere.\n\nCastle Arch is absolutely beautiful in its position and character. It is perched on a very thin fin of rock which is not apparent until you stand at the very base of the arch itself. From here you realize that it is possible to see light through three places in the arch. The base of the arch is also extremely narrow on the west side and it is offset, so that when you peer through any of the holes on the summit all that you can see is space. It is a very exhilarating experience to stand on this arch! It is also an adventure to climb. The route never exceeds about 5.5 in difficulty, but the climbing is airy in nature and there is little protection.\n\nThe route on Castle Arch ascended the south face and then the east buttress of the arch. From the western side of the south face, one traversed right on a bedding seam for roughly 15-20 feet (4.5-6 m), and then climbed up to the next bedding seam. The FA party continued to traverse on this seam until they attained the next bedding seam up. They followed the path of least resistance (up and right) until they gained the ledge at the base of the arch. You can see how narrow the base of the arch is in the photo below. From this ledge, they followed the low-angle chimney to the east to gain the buttress next to the arch. They fixed a line from the tree so they could lower themselves down into the notch between the buttress and the arch. It is only 10-12 feet (3 m) or so down to the arch.",
                      "location": "Castle Arch is located in a branch of Horse Canyon in the Needles District. Fortunately, the environmental group that sued to have Salt Creek Canyon closed to vehicles, failed in their efforts to close Horse Canyon. This is an unusual stroke of luck for us because Horse Canyon is the adjacent drainage to the east from Salt Creek. It is strange that it remains open while Salt Creek is closed, but the courts are often inconsistent in their logic.  To find Castle Arch, take a four wheel drive high clearance vehicle down Horse Canyon almost to its end (after you secure a backcountry permit from the NPS). There should be a small sign pointing to the drainage and trail leading to the arch. Follow this trail for ½ mile (1 km) to reach the arch; some scrambling will be involved.\n\nThe descent was done by downclimbing to the base of the arch and using large cams to anchor the rappel line. Rappel to the north. One individual down climbed the route after everyone else rappelled.  Hats off to Mr. Peddy."

Follow this arete-ish line up past two more bolts to the top.  The last bolt protects the 5.8 move off of the ledge.  It might stop you from hitting the ledge, but probably not... it can definitely be used to french free this challenging section. ;)\n\nThe climbing is mainly scary 5.5 throughout with a two move 5.8 thrown in as described.\n\nThe route is not aesthetic.  The rock is crap.  But the formation is nice looking, and it is fun to stand on top.  It looks easier and shorter than it is.\n\nBe extremely careful of loose rock.\n\nDescent: I used one 60 meter rope that allowed me to 'drop' to safety.
